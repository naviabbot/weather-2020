# Omaha's Highs and Lows, December 2020

I'm big into meteorology and the pseudoscience variety - astrometeorology. As such, I was quite curious to see how 'accurate' it would be. So I decided to learn R and use RMarkdown to make such a nice little report that compares the NWS Omaha's findings to The Old Farmer's Almanac 2021 (as that would be the most 'accurate', instead of the 2020 release.)
