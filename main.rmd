## Table of Highs, Lows, and Averages
All temps in Fahrenheit. Sorry Metric World.
```{r}
tempscht <- temps %>%
  mutate(avg_temp = (high + low)/2) %>%
  rename("Date" = date, "Highs" = high, "Lows" = low, "Daily Avg" = avg_temp)

## Almanac vs NWSOmaha

The Old Farmer's Almanac 2021's December Average High Prediction is 33.5°F. Meanwhile, the calculated average high from NWS Omaha predictions is `r average_high <- floor(mean(temps[,2]));average_high`°F. It appears the astrometeorological prediction is below the observations of the NWS Office at Valley, NE.
