All temps in Fahrenheit. Sorry Metric World.

## Almanac vs NWSOmaha

The Old Farmer's Almanac 2021's December Average High Prediction is `r params$a`°F. Meanwhile, the calculated average high from NWS Omaha predictions is `r params$b`°F. It appears the astrometeorological prediction is below the observations of the NWS Office at Valley, NE.
